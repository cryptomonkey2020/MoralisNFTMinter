# MoralisNFTMinter

The Soul Minter project brings artistic expression of one's soul to the minting of NFTs as avatars for the wallet holder. Users can immutably mint their crypto soul as in heaven, hell or purgatory. 
What could be more valuable than immutably minting your soul onto the blockchain? The problem was to create a scalable pipeline to enable easy minting of NFTs that are based on the user's unique wallet address and base image (avatar or profile picture). One challenge to this project was enabling on-demand minting of the NFTs from the AI/ML stack that can take as long as 30 minutes to complete. Our project also requires the use of GPUs to run because it requires the training of multiple AI/ML models to generate the underlying images for the NFTs. We have created a pipeline for generating PFP NFTs that are unique to their wallet holders from AI-generated art. Our solution will accept input from the wallet holder in the form of avatars/profile pictures, text prompt and wallet transactions to  render an NFT that unique to the wallet holder's soul. These NFTs can then be sold, traded or burned.
